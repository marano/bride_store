redirect_fu
===========

Very simple plugin for making redirections on your rails applications.

It's useful when you want to make a post request to a resource outside your application that requires a post request, for example when using visanet.


Example
=======

redirect_from_post(to, parameters)

usage:

def send_to_payment
  @visanet_sale = VisanetSale.new(params[:visanet_sale])
  redirect_from_post 'https://visanet.com/component', visanet_sale.send_to_payment_params
end

This code will build a redirect page with a form that is submited after rendered.

<form action='https://visanet.com/component' method='post'>
  <input type='hidden' name='tid' value='78437986523234' />
  ...
</form>
